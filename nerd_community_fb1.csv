You know why the best universities in the United States demand so much information from you? It's because they want to try to best understand you in person, so that they know if you're the BEST FIT for their college or if their college is best suited for you. While there isn't as much diversity in policies, course structure and faculty quality in Bangladeshi universities, it is completely up to the individual to decide which university you want to go to. There isn't an OBJECTIVE RANKING that ranks NSU over BRAC or BRAC over IBA and what not. Remember it isn't MIT vs NSU here.

A LOT(and I can't emphasize this enough) depends on the student himself. I mean, look at the Mystery Box challenge in MasterChef- do all the contestants create the same beautiful dish using the SAME ingredients given to them? No! On the contrary, everyone produces a distinctive dish of distinct taste. Hell, there are at times even multiple winners- which suggest that WINNING itself is diverse. Similarly, 2 students going to X university will utilize the SAME(or similar) facilities differently. Yet 2 students from 2 different universities (hence facilities) can succeed in their own individual goals!

Thus, please stop making such petty, baseless arguments that will only confuse the inquirer even more. 

To the prospective student- believe me it is IMMENSELY up to YOU how you make use of the Mystery Box; regardless of what you get, you must believe that YOU CAN COOK A GREAT DISH.

A Pacifist and YOUR Moderator.",Fahad Dewan,,status,,12/22/2016 13:48,157,10,1,107,44,1,2,3,0,m

For a lot of you, exams are just a couple of weeks away! So it is high time to brush up your grammar skills. In the exam, the students are required to write in Standard English.That doesn’t mean you have to use “Shakespeare English” but you must not use “Murad Takla” English(Yes, Frans). Most students lose marks in “language style” – which is mixing up the tone and choice of words. 

The following list will help you to recognise the informal and formal ways of saying the same thing.

I hope this is allowed, mods pls don't delete. Need the help.

Need your help with Alpha testing an iOS/Android app I'm developing. I need 79 Alpha testers from Bangladesh.

Firstly, What's in it for you?

Once you finish atleast 13 coversions you'll receive a 5$ gift card of your choice. Choices are limited to Steam, Google PlayStore, Apple App Store, Origin, Battle.net, Facebook, Amazon and eBay.

What do you have to do?

The app UI is extremely simple and self-explanatory.

This test will require maximum 3 minutes of your valuable time. 
The app is about converting goods and services price from USD to BDT (not only limited to BDT, but you guys will get access to BDT only). Now it's not basic currency conversion like multiplying 78 to any dollar amount. This is sort of like True Conversion.

For example, getting a normal hair cut in new york varies from 10-15$. Now in BDT that doesn't make sense at all if you directly convert amount. 1000tk for a haircut sounds insane. So this app will convert that 15$ service cost to BDT considering all the factors like minimum wage, living cost et cetera so that amount it makes sense.

Basically how much 15$ service from NY should cost in Dhaka. Now this is quite complex. One formula cannot tru convert all types of goods or service price. This is where I need your help. I need your help refining the adaptive algorithm this app is using with atleast 2000 conversions. So that, the algorithm can automatically recognize what variable to use for the conversion of said service or good. 2000 combinations of conversions is too much for 1 person so I need y'all's help.

NOTES: 1) THIS APP WILL NEVER LEAVE THE ALPHA PHASE. This app is an experiment for the algorithm.

2) The app requires no private information or permissions to install. So becareful while installing, if it doesn require any sort of permission you're downloading the wrong one.

3) All I need is your email at the moment. I will mail you once the app is ready for you guys. Also note, by agreeing to participate in the alpha test you're also agreeing to these following terms and conditions:
 > No sharing access codes. Sharing access codes will terminate your right to the 5$ gift card.
 > One person cannot apply two times. Applying twice eliminates any chance of becoming a tester.
 > Cannot convert the same combination more than once. 
Terms and conditions are subject to change without notice and maybe updated if need be.

How to sign up? 
Just sign up through this google forms link. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaesCbj472knwo-0NyMFm_6vvWY0joGIkI06eaU_hJvqabLA/viewform

EDEXCEL A Levels Economics tips - the Big Daddy of them all:

The issue that most students consistently face in the mocks is firstly, time management, and secondly, framing the answer properly. I can't help you with time management, that is a personal issue that you guys MUST practice to deal with. Economics is a race against time, not just in A Levels but for later on if you want to pursue it in higher levels as well. And it's always going to be about writing - a LOT of writing. It almost makes me not miss Literature, that's how much we have to write, and how detailed and nuanced our writings have to be. A Levels sets the absolute basic foundations for that. 

Let's begin with Section A. For AS, Section A is MCQs. Don't get lazy - I know there are ways around this, but writing the explanations in the proper way will help YOU in the long run. One mark for definition, one mark for explanation, one mark for analysis/application. What does that mean? So for instance, let's say the question says that the rate of inflation fell from 4% to 1%, which of the following is true. The correct answer is that this means that the purchasing power of money has fallen (if you don't understand why this is the right option, please comment below, I'll explain it in details :) ). For the first mark, define EITHER inflation OR disinflation, not both. And please learn the exact definitions, I cannot stress this enough. The reason why we ask you to learn the exact definitions is that when you try to write it in your own words you often mess up the true meaning. It's easy enough, there's not much to learn, I feared memorization my entire life; if I can do it, so can you. For the second mark, explain what is happening: prices rise, value of money falls because one unit of currency buys fewer goods. For the third mark, relate back to the question, fall from 4% to 1% means that prices are still rising because the rate is still positive, but at a slower rate. For more tips on how to get this right - practice the question papers, read the mark schemes, that's how you learn. 

Additionally, if it is mathematical, there's a sure-shot scope for full marks if you guys get the right option. 1 mark for definition and 2 marks for showing the steps of the calculation. Important note: you know those questions that show the multiple shifting of the curves, AD and SRAS? You need to explain why AD shifted (1 mark) why SRAS shifted (1 mark) AND the effect on price level and quantity output as a result (1 mark). Most students miss out on this last part and write definitions instead - no marks for definition here. 

If you're truly stumped, write rejection points. However, that's what I call being lazy, and I personally don't encourage this unless it's a last resort - messes up with how your brain works in terms of framing answers. Nevertheless, DO add rejection points just as a safety measure, sometimes even if you miss out on explanation and write 3 rejection points, you still get the mark. 

Section A for A2 is slightly more complicated, but manageable none the same. To begin with, understand the mark allocations. For Unit 3, you have 20 marks for each question. Which means that you need to have roughly 12 marks for explanation and 8 marks for evaluation. The break down of these vary, which is what makes it difficult to understand what to write - but remember that you KNOW most of these things, don't get nervous. Some answers have a lot of definitions (such as questions about cost curves, shut down point, etc) which need to be written as explanations. Others such as the ones on mergers have a lot that you can explain - don't waste a lot of time in writing definitions for those. Write around 5 to 6 explanation points, and 4 to 5 evaluations. Also, I keep repeating this over and over again, but this is important - please don't just state the points, you need to explain them. My friends and I had a running joke during A Levels that we have to write around 320 lines for just 80 marks in Economics, because writing 4 lines earns us 1 mark. Cue jealousy for Physics and Chemistry where there are questions where just writing the keywords gains you marks. 

For Unit 4, the first question is 15 marks and 24 marks for the second. The second answer normally has around 14 marks for explanation, 10 for evaluation and 1 for a conclusive statement. The first is around 8 marks for explanation, 6 for evaluations and 1 for a conclusive statement. However, this is not strictly maintained and once more, depends on the answer. Make sure that these are the bare minimum that you cover though. For the first question in Unit 4, have around 4 to 5 different explanation points, and for the second have around 6 to 7 different ones. Once again - this is not strictly maintained, if some explanations are very well developed, that works too. Read the mark schemes and examiner's reports to get a gist of what I mean. It's not the quantity of the points that matter but rather the quality - so even if you write 10 explanation points with no proper development, you will get less marks than someone who wrote around 3 to 4 explanation points that was beautifully developed and linked with each other and back to the question, relating more with real life scenarios. Try not to be too bookish guys, the examiners know what the book says, most of them wrote it themselves. xD This is an essay and this is economics, your analysis matters, this is not something you can or should attempt to memorise.

Moving on to Section B, it is relatively simpler. For AS, it is ABSOLUTELY straightforward. There's a MAX of 2 marks for definitions, 2 marks for diagram if it's relevant, MAX two marks for data reference. I stress on the MAX because candidates get carried away and spend way too long on definitions and data references. No matter which unit or what the question is, NEVER more than 2 marks for data reference. They expect you to build your explanations and analysis around the information in the extract, but don't just quote the extract guys, max 2 marks for quoting figures. So for instance, if the extract talks about collusion and there's evidence of whistleblowing, the examiners will be expecting game theory and whistleblowing incorporated in your evaluations and explanations. Remember when your teacher said ""you don't have to write ALL the points, write ANY 3""? Yeah, that's the examiners dropping mad hints that you'll basically not score Level 3 or 4 marks (i.e. not more than 70% of the marks) unless you specifically talk about those particular points in your answer. The same applies for Unit 3 and 4 too. However, what puts the 2 in A2 is the fact that you are taught many more theories in A2 (Harrod-Domar model, Lewis model, Prebische-Singer hypothesis, Laffer curve, etc). Fancy names, basically, they need you to use and refer to the fancy names.The mark allocation stays the same, just go through any random mark scheme from the recent years and it should be clear to you.

Some concluding tips - if you haven't already, start solving the question papers and read the mark schemes and examiner's reports. Don't just read, practice WRITING the answers to questions in the papers and time yourself. Give yourself less time to finish it than the allocated time. When you're at home, you're not stressed and you're comfortable, your brain works better, so you should need (and practice to need) less time. During the exam and the mock, more often than not I've personally had situations where I blanked out completely. It's therefore important to train your brain to finish the papers with time to spare where you can include the freaking out part during the exam. 

And finally, relax guys, you got this. You've studied the whole year. You KNOW these stuff. You just need to show the examiners all that you know. All the best wishes.

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek: The unlikely scientist

One of the most intriguing stories in the history of science is that of the Dutch draper Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who owing to his curiosity and diligence became the ""father"" of the field of microbiology.

Hailing from a family of tradesmen, having  no fortune and receiving no higher education, van Leeuwenhoek made a name for himself as one of the most in demand drapers in the city of Delft. In order to aid his craft and be able to pick out the finest of fabrics, he invented a form of compound microscope which would allow him to observe the binding of his fabrics in more detail. 

One day, he decided to explore his garden using the tiny invention and what he discovered was tiny moving microorganisms,which he originally referred to as animalcules. His works along with the works of Robert Hooke during that period led to the formation of the field of microbiology.",Khadiza Karim Chowdhury Rodella,Photos from Khadiza Karim Chowdhury Rodella's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202339753093423&set=gm.1314213435266225&type=3,12/10/2016 12:43,12,0,0,10,1,1,0,0,0,f

Her research delves into black holes, the nature of gravity and spacetime. A particular focus is trying to better understand “quantum gravity,” which seeks to explain the phenomenon of gravity within the context of quantum mechanics.

1026292020725036_1306681462686089,"| TO ALL OUR WELL WISHERS |

In 2003, a small mobile game development company from Finland appeared on the map. Taking their cue from the likes of Hasbro, the U.S. giant of interactive games, they wanted to create a small, fun, and dead-cheap game. Operating in the country where Nokia had so dominated the digital landscape, it came, naturally, to use smart phones as their platform. Six years later Rovio Entertainment launched Angry Birds. On May 9, 2012, the company announced the one-billionth download of the game.

One needs to look no further than Netflix and Blockbuster—and Skype and the entire telecommunication world—for similar stories. Small startups, which despite all the odds, manage to succeed against well-established conglomerates with all the expertise that money can buy.

If you'd entered Facebook’s headquarters sometime around 2010, you’d have seen a sign painted on the wall: ""Done is better than perfect."" I know it sounds strange as a motto and yet, had Facebook waited so much as a year to perfect its model, the company might very well be where MySpace is today.

So how come Facebook or Angry Birds is parable to Nerd Community?

Yesterday, we had launched our website in the Nerd Huddle 1.0 event. Since then we have been overflowed with mixed responses. A lot of our well wishers are perplexed with the fact of ‘lack of resources” in our website.We knew we were not completely ready with all the resources especially the CIE ones; we could’ve waited another few months uploading stack of resources and then try announcing it, however, we decided to give a go.

""Done is better than perfect"" is not about coming up with ideas; it’s about believing in them. And having an attitude that compels us to run with the idea before it's too late. We, the proud members of NC, are working day and night trying to do that exact same thing. We believe we can help build a better community for a better future filled with wonder about the world of knowledge. And now, all we need is your love and support.

Sure you can find out a lot online but it's difficult for a lot of people. Counselling in Bangladesh is a rip off too. Kids throw away loads of money for info that's available for free. Also most schools don't know much about the application process atleast mine didn't.
Then there's the issue of what you need to do once you make it to a university. Kids abroad learn that in highschool with AP classes and stuff. So the only way to learn things for Bangladeshi international students is essentially to make mistakes.
Maybe the community can find seniors already attending the university for sort of like a mentorship kind of thing. These are all things I wish I had. It would've made things A LOT easier. All this information made easily accessible and for free would probably help get more opportunities for Bangladeshi students keen on trying to get into good schools.

I know a bunch of my own batchmates who have a tonne of potential but couldn't apply because they didn't know some of these things when they were just starting their A levels. This could be a way for current international students to give back.

First of all, congratulations to Jannat Ferdous & Co. for a very successful ""Nerd Huddle 1.0"" and website launching. 
As someone responsible for the C.I.E section of the website, I feel the need to explain the lack of C.I.E resources in it. Simply put, the compilation of Edexcel resources by NC started way before that of C.I.E.Thus, our C.I.E department has been working equally hard to make resources available to you and from now onwards we will be working even harder to put Cambridge materials online as soon as we can. Bottom line: Nerd Community website will be overflowing with Cambridge resources at least 3 months before the next CIE exam session InshaAllah. Thanks.

1026292020725036_1305085982845637,"Today's SAT Question 

Writing & Language
After reading the passage, choose the answer to the question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Sometimes the question will include a ""NO CHANGE"" option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.
Ghosts, haunted houses, ancestral curses—these common tropes of Gothic literature might lead some readers to dismiss the genre as one better suited for entertainment than for serious literary scholarship. An analysis of Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s 1892 short story “The Yellow Wallpaper,” though, demonstrates that the Gothic was a vehicle for serious social commentary worthy of further study. The story’s protagonist, suffering from a “nervous condition,” becomes obsessed with the wallpaper in her bedroom. At one point, she conjures a disturbing image of a woman trapped behind the bars depicted in the pattern of the wallpaper. Though utterly fantastical, this image is very much grounded in the reality of the oppressive mores of the Victorian era: the trapped figure symbolizes the protagonist’s sense of being imprisoned by her social circumstances. (1 Since its inception with Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto in 1764, Gothic literature has been frightening reading audiences around the globe.)

#####The writer is considering deleting the underlined sentence. Should the sentence be kept or deleted?
A) Kept, because it illustrates how the analysis of Gilman’s story applies throughout the broader category of Gothic literature. 
B) Kept, because it provides a second example that supports the paragraph’s claim that the social commentary found in Gothic literature is worthy of further study.
C) Deleted, because it contradicts the paragraph’s claim that some readers dismiss the genre of Gothic literature. 
D) Deleted, because it weakens the paragraph’s conclusion by introducing loosely related information about the general topic of Gothic literature.",Shamim M Hayatul Islam,,status,,12/3/2016 6:17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,m

Guys. Please read the question properly. For the love of all things holy. If the question asks you to examine/assess the effects of a depreciation DO NOT WRITE ABOUT THE FACTORS WHICH CAUSE THE CURRENCY TO DEPRECIATE. 

A factor of currency depreciation (i.e. NOT WHAT THE QUESTION ASKED FOR):
Higher foreign interest rate causes hot money outflow, the supply of domestic currency increases in the international currency market, leading to a depreciation.

Effect of currency depreciation (i.e. what the question actually asked for):
A currency depreciation makes exports cheaper and imports expensive, thus exports rise, could improve the balance of payment current account. On the other hand, import of raw materials becomes expensive, could lead to cost-push inflation, etc. etc.

Most of the people gets confused about the homophones. (same sound different meaning) 
Wrong spelling of some specific words can change the whole meaning of your writing. So, be careful while using those. 

From now on some of those words with their meanings will be posted regularly (hopefully). 

1. অন্ন : ভাত ( Rice)  ( দুপুরের আহারে অন্নর বিকল্প নাই)
    অন্য : অপর (another) অন্য কোন রং দেয়া যায় না? 

2. আপন : নিজ (own) ও আমার আপন ভাই।
     আপণ : দোকান ( Shop)  মহাখালীতে তার আপণটি উঠে গেছে। 

3. উদ্দেশ : অভিমুখ ( address) তোমার উদ্দেশে এই বইটি পাঠিয়েছি।
   উদ্দেশ্য : অভিপ্রায় ( motive)  হঠাৎ এত বছর পর বেড়াতে আসা? নিশ্চয়ই কোন উদ্দেশ্য আছে।

Mathematics Olympiad Preparation
ADIB HASAN·SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 2016
The most wonderful time of my life was spent surrounded by olympiad mathematics. So when someone asks me, how to prepare for the Mathematics Olympiad, I really think that it's more like thinking about a math Olympiad. This note is written in such a suit everyone. Him reading the note at the outset that the guidelines do not tell it. You can follow it if you want, you can take it again. The note at the beginning of the Mathematics Olympiad silver medal in the last year from the IMO to come back until I'm done, what you've read or summary of the experiences.  
How to serve:
 If you want to go aiemaote, but many, many would have to serve. There is no hard and fast rules on how the task will be. I can only speak for myself. I started 6th grade math Olympiad. 5-10 hours a week I barely had the time to do the task; And it was not regular. The increase in the 9th grade is a day for 3-4 hours. Of course yes, sometimes a month due to other commitments, there would not have anything. (Sebacharai I first went aiemaote) In fact, the 10th class (013), I began to be seriously reckoned with. Then my daily sum of the volume continues to grow. Finally, last year (015) was the extent of my reading is 1214 hours in the day.
How much time to give back an amount of:
""Those who are better problem solvers are not necessarily more genius than you. They only attack the problems just like mad dogs"" -- Dr. Mahbub Majumdar 
At the beginning I could not say that ankata try to go up. If you can not be after 4-5 hours, but will sit again on another day. Once a problem after the 7th grade, I was probably the one and a half months. If you absolutely can not, then the only solution will see. But the solution is not to just dive going through one eye. Rather, the issue is how the idea was also to think. (More about this later said.) But when you become a senior, (step 7) can not be spending so much time on the course. Because then the war will be over time you. At the time fixed for 3 hours, sometimes if you do not resolve to see you.
Math is much higher:
 IMO difficult not only learn theory. There is no need even for a calculus janarao. IMO is the ability of the test to solve your problem. But what does that mean straight aiemaora problems? Not at all. IMO would not gain anything but the theory is so difficult to learn. Here everyone is equal amounts of hand tools (theorem) it. Who will be able to do it with, but it depends on creativity. Let's take an example. You understand that 1 / k = 1 / 2k + 1 / 2k? (Who does not know it!), But do you know that 5 of 014 IMO official number of problems to solve this equation has been used? Yet the problem is very low pratiyogii fully able to sit the exam. (Many, however, have after the test, I am one of them: /)
Again, there is sometimes a problem using one of the many superior jhatakaya any theorem can be solved. But it's not just in any way. Because the problem was solved by using higher Theorem, then maybe I could learn a trick or technique it takes to solve other problems. Moreover, if proved superior thioremagulora theory is advanced, but using the solution will not be accepted. For example, there was the problem of Chebotarev's Density Theorem 3 008 aiemaora the corollary of a higher Theorem. But that issue can not be used in the theorem. If someone were aiemaote, the solution would not be acceptable.
So always salabha problem all the time, 'known', and 'simple' to use accessories. What is everyone? The theorem almost everyone knows, most of the books are available. The 'simple' mean that such a theorem, which will be able to prove yourself.
Solutions to write the flame:
 just enter the solution becoming very, very important. Remember that the amount to be able to properly and be able to convince everyone entering saliusanata two different things. The second important because if it's not, but it is only written evidence may prove to complicate you. So one does not have to prove your case, you know you can not get the number. I suffered myself of. 015 on the IMO Problem 1 despite all the evidence I have two points deducted just because of this. I missed two silver medals for points. : '(
Solutions to learn to write a note: httpsgooglbxYnOk 
How to prepare for the Olympiad:
 Regional Olympiad is a problem, a problem IMO 6 sizes are in the midst of a long way to achieve efficiency. I've shared a few steps to facilitate discussion. You see the first step of what you read, then start to follow the instructions.
Step 0:
 This step will mean that you have to start at the Mathematical Olympiad, ancalike or jatiyate took part, received or did not get the prize. Adnan Tariq bronze instructions for your ex-moon has written down before. (Appendix has been given link) This note is written for you. Still, the four could speak. www.expii.com of the notes that you can see. NIMO, OMO can solve the problem. In addition, you have resonance neurons, neurons that resonate through the books to see. Problem Solving these books absolutely ideal to start. When I started it, (6th grade) 00 + 00 = 400, then these two books together in the midst of the problems I had to solve the problem as 300. Of course, you do not have much. When do you think this will be very easy baidutira problems, then you know that you have passed Phase 0.
Step 1:
 If you managed to get the first camp to be at the national level, then this step. In the meantime, you need to start reading English books. Said another. It's not mandatory, but it is very essential to know the English camp. This is because literature is required Bengal famine. Those weaknesses in English, I can assure them, there is nothing to fear about English Olympiad. The book is not meant to say that we no longer Victorian English literature. Moreover, the IMO math or English proficiency test camp verification tests. So the question math and English books are very simple, like a 6th-7th grade English. Empty mathematical terms are known, then all will understand. You will then The Art & Craft of Problem Solving. It is an extraordinary book. It will, eksarasaijagulio with it. The geometry of this book is not for discussion. For this book you need to read the books as well as the old 6-10 geometry class, thioremagulora prove to be understood, to be eksatragulo manually. At least two hours after the end of the day it is you will do math.
In the meantime, you will have to open accounts at the same time bidiemao forum. No problem if the post will give solutions or evidence. Sometimes, especially at the beginning of what you think the right solution, but others are out to show the wrong time. Post Forum to see if someone else over time, you'll make a mistake. Moreover, remember, not all great ideas never come to your own head. So you have to practice to solve others. No problem, though the official solution will see. If new ideas if no solution, then try to think that the idea resolver on the key, or just what to worry about the can? Is it possible to use a new problem? That's why, in the forum, senior camper / IMO Team Members posts you will read. It's really a lot of, a lot of work permits.  
Step Two:
 This is the next step to go home from the camp. In the meantime, Nine-Ten Art & Craft and the geometry of the old book, you should come to an end. Then you will start to fall camp, the materials that have been provided. In this step you are going to four objects aiemaora Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry and Number Theory to start with a thematic study. Each subject individually like reading books and notes list the below given. Can you see them. What about when your skills will continue to increase, then a lot of the things will begin to solve the problem. Because, do not solve the problem, the problem solver can not be left empty.

যখন তোমার Geometry Revisited, Plane Euclidean Geometry, Geometry Unbound, Elementary Number Theory-র মত বইগুলো শেষ হয়ে যাবে, তখন তুমি বুঝতে পারবে গণিতের কোন বিশেষ শাখা তুমি বেশি ভালো পার এবং কোন একটা শাখায় তোমার দুর্বলতা আছে। এটা বুঝতে পারলেই এই ধাপ শুরু। যেখানে তোমার দুর্বলতা আছে সেখানে তোমার বেশি সময় দিতে হবে। একইসাথে, এখন থেকে তোমাকে ভাগে ভাগে প্ল্যান করে অংক করতে হবে। যেমন- তুমি অ্যালজেব্রা আগে করবে নাকি জ্যামিতি? নিঃসন্দেহে জ্যামিতি। কারণ বাংলাদেশ জ্যামিতিতে খুবই ভালো। আইএমও টিমে ঢুকতে হলে জ্যামিতি ছাড়া কোন গতি নেই।
Solving a problem like this in the Journal of Mathematical Excalibur, you will start to fall. It countless problems, troubleshooting techniques and have Theorem. I read the first 17 volumes. (Apart from Chinese text). This journal is a good problem. Will resolve them. In addition, another journal Mathematical Reflection- you will see some volume. (You do not need to read it all, does not work)
Since this time, you will start to see Shortlists aiemaora problem. (Like a 5-30 at the Shortlists on the IMO a list of problems. From there aiemaora problem voting for the election is six.) The IMO Compendium for the name of the book you will collect. It is the last aiemaogulora (until 004), and the solution of all the problems Shortlists. From here, the problem will be solved.  
Needless to say, these problems are equivalent rigor aiemaora problems. So, if you can not solve a problem, and there is nothing to be disappointed. You have the courage to try, that's a big thing. Aiemaora amount means big hard things, the idea should be removed. And yes, remember, IMO 1980, and between 015 aiemaora phamraka lot. In those days, if a problem does not make sense today.
There are Shortlists 20052009 IMOMath-'s website. The next sartalistagulo aiemaora you take it off the official site. I would say that 000 after the Shortlists problem to see. These can. If you wish it. (IMOMath- the website of the National Olympiad, there are problems in many countries. They can see that. Appendix has been given link.)
Shortlists aiemaora problem is the size of the problem. Algebra, Geometry, Combinatorics, Number Theory- rigor of the problem is sorted by each early 67ti. For example, a year-A1 (Algebra 1) is the most simple ayalajebra, which is difficult as the problems commonly aiemaora 1 or No. 4. The A6 or A7 is the most difficult ayalajebra, aiemaora 3 or 6 quality problems.
Shortlists will be looking for another job as well. That myathalinkse open the account. And the world's best myathalinksa salabharera reign problem. Here, dozens of members. The post of the house can not be. At the end of the note I gave the names of some members. Their posts will.
Myathalinkse Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory and Combinatorics- separate forum on here. They will visit regularly. If the problem is of course better solutions. There are various national and international Olympiad problem myathalinksera contest section. Will it. I have a list of appendices.
Step 4:  
In this step, you will be able to issue IMO 1 or 4-in. But it will take time. Now is the time to practice, so that the problems of 4 to 1 or not it takes the whole day. Shortlists after all this time, 000-A1-A2, C1-C2, G1-G2, N1-N2 Purge. The next step is the thing about stereotypes. There will solve the problem. Olympiad and the national electoral test questions will begin to be seen. Shortlists G3-4, N3-4 focus on these; Willy six to eight hours, you can do a lot of that. (In fact, many big thing to try) to solve others, will prove. If some of the important things to keep in mind. And this note at this stage that the resources were talking about the end of the will. The question of the old camp, Problem Set- from the siniyadera will gather. See how many you can. Then you will understand where the level. The question is usually the national camp, the Bangladesh coach Mahbub Majumdar, sir. And the question is no longer the tests IMO Shortlists from the previous year. (Not only in Bangladesh, many countries of the world, from the previous year Shortlists problem by using their own camp. Aiemaora Shortlists is why they are not released until the following year IMO.)
Step 5:  
In this step any A1-2, C1-2, G1-2, N1-2-level issues that you should be able to make very quickly. For example, it may take up to 1 hour. In the meantime, you can be rest assured that aiemaora 1 to 4, you can do it no problem. IMO, you will qualify to receive esamayai bronze. (The stage is the place you should go to Bangladesh ganitadale) In the meantime, the scale of the problem you aiemaora No. 25 to start. The same thing again. Greater than the fear of being spent. Thus, try to bum a sudden your level will increase and you will see that a lot of A3-4, G3-4 to resolve these problems on a regular basis, you have to start. (Yes, it may take up to 6-8 hours)
Step 6:
 1,4 IMO this step will further decline to the level of the problem. IMO level 25 will be able to sit with the problem of time. In the meantime, do what you will, that part of your innate math skills, the level should be increased a lot. At the same time the issues have weaknesses, they pichanero time to pay. And, you have to catch the problem IMO level 3,6. Yes, you will have trouble. And in most cases you can not fail. But there is nothing to be disappointed. Resonant than the pressure if we do not ever endurance will not increase. A time to try and see if you too have some IMO 3,6 quality problems. (The first time such a hard problem to be feeling just wonderful. Self-confidence is significantly higher then.: D)
Shortlists the next 000-A1-A5, C1-C4, G1-G6, N1-N6 until at least 4-5 hours each time will give you back problems. The problem is that in the meantime, I will see if we can not solve.  
Step 7:
 When you feel it is a step in the N1-N6, G1-G6, A1-A5, C1-C4- hardness of most of the problems you can solve the khatakhatani 10-1 hours (or main idea is to pass) . This time hundreds of new tricks or learning theorem is. Just before tekanikaguloi ways to learn is to learn how to apply. (Remember, however, this step 'panditammanya ""There's nothing to mind. There is no learning. This phase of the study Solutions Sometimes you will see a new technique, or, he'll find out.) Then you have to fight just to reduce the time. Aiemaote will not have time to 10 hours, there will be four and a half hours. I'm the dhapatate. I do not know what the next step. If you start today, this note is to follow, and I hope in the next 24 years, also arrived in this step. 
Thematic guidelines:
Algebra
 aiemaote ayalajebrara The problem is, they do not need to know in order to solve very advanced theory. Intuisana with a lot of little things that can be removed. Ayalajebrara problems can be divided into several phases. Every step that separates talking about:
Functional Equation
 these kinds of problems is no theory to learn. Functional Equation aharahai also be seen, but still dangerous. Functional Equation salbha to learn the only way to get lots, lots of functional equation to be solved.
Q aiemaora changed constantly. Now comes to the problem of many kinds. The three-dimensional geometry aiemaote not seen as a problem. Functional Equation, but never such a thing is old. They were and always will be.

Geogebra or Cabri Geometry forgotten the images will not draw any software. Figure drawing is perfect for the practice exam. Moreover, software images can be handled by one G6 to be able to test at the G4- and might be unable to.  
Analytic Geometry:
 a synthetic (= iuklidiyana) geometry, if it is learned does not. And the problem is also with Analytics. Still many problems Analytics with easy. Remember, however, aiemaora geometry problems (except 1,4) emanabhabei are selected so that they are not easy to ayanalaitikabhabe.
Moreover, in order to ayanalaitikabhabe any step to solve the biggest problem is if you are wrong, but will not be part of the number. Therefore, if it can match the estimates, the number will be, and if not, zero. That's why the test ayanalaitikabhabe gambling seemed like a problem to me episodes. Even if someone enalaitika geometry are interested, you can read the rest of the words.  
Coordinate to solve the problem through the trouble. Estimates are often very complex. Some of the problems are easily vectors, not the rest. So I would say if you learn analytic geometry, complex numbers, or to learn aerial. (Geometry of complex numbers, but actually kind of position vector geometry)

Note: in order to solve the problem in number theory number Olympiad reading and a lot of times there is a big difference. Olympiad problems are not messy at all sorts of number of functions. Olympiad is the thing, they are usually very easy to remove without accessories. So rather than learning a new theorem applied to the same kind of learning is more important theorem. (The last line here is actually the topic applies to all bets. For example, if you use AM-GM Inequality can. But what can you really? Secrets in Inequalities vol 1-read the first chapter. I could really use AM-GM? )

Light from distant quasars—early galaxies that shine with tremendous brightness—has given researchers a new clue to the(5) origin of vast magnetic fields studding today's galaxies: They were running strong when the universe was only a third of its present age.
(10) Astronomers had observed that radio emissions from quasars tend to be angled, or polarized, in such a way that powerful magnetic fields must have twisted them. The(15) greater their distance from Earth, the more polarized their light. But researchers didn't know whether the magnetic fields were part of the quasar or were present in(20) galaxies encountered by quasar light as it made its journey to our telescopes. 
So a team led by astronomers from the Swiss Federal Institute of(25) Technology (ETH Zurich) scanned more than 70 of those quasars using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile to look for signs(30) of galaxies hiding in front of the quasars. Specifically, they checked for a feature called the magnesium(II) absorption line, a reduction in the intensity of light of(35) a certain wavelength, which is a commonly used indicator that gas from a star-forming galaxy has soaked up that light. 
The researchers report that(40) light from quasars showing the magnesium(II) line was more strongly polarized than light from other quasars in the sample. The interpretation: [that] light did(45) indeed pass through regular galaxies and that it likely acquired its polarization in the process. 
They estimated the age of the magnetic galaxies by measuring(50) the red shift of the absorption line—the observed reddening of light that occurs when galaxies move rapidly apart. The typical red shift of the inferred galaxies(55) corresponded to an age of 5.2 billion years, study author Francesco Miniati says. Precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background peg (60) today’s universe at 13.7 billion years old.

**Which choice best characterizes the study described in the passage?
A) Astronomers used technology to confirm the existence and location of a distance object.
B) Astronomers produced computer models depicting a past state.
C) Astronomers demonstrated that a generally accepted theory is flawed.
D) Astronomers drew two conclusions from a study of one phenomenon.",Shamim M Hayatul Islam,,status,,11/16/2016 7:34,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,m

1026292020725036_1280865128601056,"#CollegeAdmissions #Recommendations 
Many of the US universities ask for recommendations from 2 teachers usually of core academic subjects - maths, english, sciences, languages and social sciences. At the same time, it's strongly advised that the recommendations are from teachers who taught you more recently instead of back in 9th and 10th grades. Now most of us, studying in the british patterned system, we usually tend to prefer a combination of complementary subjects and opt for either the sciences or business subjects entirely. 
So the question is, should I take a recommendation from a science /math teacher of 11th/12th grade and an english/economics teacher who taught me two years ago. Or would it be better to take recommendations from two recent science teachers instead? Or, perhaps take one from a science teacher and one my accounting teacher, however, the latter isn't considered a core subject. 

I know I sound overly meticulous but would genuinely appreciate it if anyone who has undergone the process sheds some light on it.",Khadiza Karim Chowdhury Rodella,,status,,11/12/2016 11:18,18,6,0,17,1,0,0,0,0,f

Some plant pathologists have turned to genetic engineering to devise new ways of responding to botanical diseases. Plant pathologist William Powell, for instance, teamed up with forest biologist Chuck Maynard to restore North America’s population of American chestnut trees, which was decimated in the early 1900s by a fungus known as chestnut blight. A fungus, C. parasitica, contributes to the growth of cankers on the trees’ trunks; these cankers, in turn, prevent (1 a tree) from transporting water from their roots to their branches and leaves. To render American chestnut trees resistant to the blight, Powell and Maynard experimented with altering the genetic makeup of the trees. The resultant genetically engineered trees are called Darling 4 American chestnut trees, and during the first 15 weeks after infection with chestnut blight, they grow cankers that are much smaller than those that grow on American chestnut trees.

""#CommonVerbs that DO NOT change in the past tense"" (1/2)

While writing a narrative story in section C, students are advised to use the past tense since it is familiar for the readers. However, majority of the students find this extremely difficult to maintain and thus, they lose precious marks. To help you more, sentence examples are given below:

1) COST- *present* This blazer costs too much.
*past* I did not buy the blazer because it cost too much.

2) FIT- *present* Those blue jeans still fit me.
*past* Last night, I tried those jeans and it still fit me.

3) BEAT- *present* I think I can beat you in chess.
*past* Yesterday, Jashim beat Monu in a chess game.

4) QUIT - *present* Well, don't quit on it entirely.
*past Selina did not listen to me and quit one week ago.

5) HIT- *present* This type of glass won't shatter no matter how hard you hit it.
*past* At their silence, another thought hit her.",Raihan Soumik,,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1329389603761617&set=gm.1278449482175954&type=3,11/10/2016 11:04,14,0,0,13,0,1,0,0,0,m

This passage is from a speech delivered on August 6, 2015 by United States President Barack Obama, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

Conceptually, everybody is in favor of the right to vote. You will not hear anybody defend the notion that the law can(5) discriminate against persons because of their color, or their faith, or their ethnicity, when it comes to going to cast a ballot. That’s huge progress, a normative(10) shift in how we think about our democracy. Everybody in theory is supposed to be included. 
But part of the reason we’re here today, part of the reason it’s(15) so important for us to focus attention on this right is because in practice, we’ve still got problems. 
On the ground, there are still too(20) many ways in which people are discouraged from voting. Some of the protections that had been enshrined in the Voting Rights Act itself have been weakened as a(25) consequence of court decisions and interpretations of the law. State legislatures have instituted procedures and practices that, although on the surface may(30) appear neutral, have the effect of discouraging people from voting, may have a disproportional effect on certain kinds of folks voting. 
And if, in fact, those practices,(35) those trends, those tendencies are allowed to continue unanswered, then over time the hard-won battles of 50 years ago erode, and our democracy erodes. And that(40) means that the decisions that are made in the corridors of power all across this country begin to reflect the interests of the few, instead of the interests of the many. 
(45)So we’ve got serious business to attend to here. One order of business is for our Congress to pass an updated version of the Voting Rights Act that would(50) correct some of the problems that have arisen.

#### Obama uses the word “business” twice in the last paragraph most likely in order to

A) Indicate that practical steps should be taken.
B) Identify the source of a persistent problem.
C) Suggest a way to fix a broken system.
D) Shift attention to another group of people.",Shamim M Hayatul Islam,,status,,11/8/2016 7:18,4,2,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,m

(Since on FB i can nor underline the part, i have kept the problem in a bracket)

To show how a common desk fan cools a person, Rhett Allain, a physics professor and writer for Wired magazine, performed a simple experiment. He wet a paper towel with warm water and wrapped it around a thermometer. Allain wrapped a second thermometer in a dry paper towel, and then he set both thermometers in front of a fan. Initially the fan was turned off. The temperature of the thermometer wrapped in the wet paper towel decreased, at first rapidly, and then more slowly, eventually dropping below room temperature. After the fan was turned on, the temperature of the wet thermometer underwent another rapid decrease. By contrast, the temperature of the thermometer wrapped in the dry paper towel barely changed during the entire experiment. This experiment demonstrated the power of evaporation to cool wet 1( objects, such as a sweaty person,) and the role of a fan in making evaporation more effective.

A. NO CHANGE

1026292020725036_1271136319573937,"Hey everyone! As the January 2017 exams are only 2 months away and the mocks are running, I have got a couple of questions on how to improve marks in Accounting AS specially, for the new specification. So below are some tips and tricks and methods. Hope the students find this helpful:  

1. I have gone through the new specification and have collected information that marks for theory have been fixed this time. Hence, work very well on the formats first. This is important because regardless of anything this carries the most marks.

2. In order to improve you don't really have to memorize everything. I would suggest to first go through every single format and get to know them. Afterwards, figure out how a transaction istaking place and what effect it has on the final accounts. Once you have done that, you will not only answer the maths properly but score more marks in evaluations. 

3. For Accounting AS a chapter most students I have seen to avoid is Ratio Analysis. However, I would recommend students to answer it as it requires you to just use the formulae and theory. If you are good at theory this can help you score a lot marks.

4. For those of you who are worried about making constant silly mistakes, go through MS. It really helps! Going through the MS gives you an idea on answering and mark allocation.           

5. The new mark allocation system, or the Assessment objective system that's worrying many students. What it actually checks is how well informed you are about accounting. So you need to linkchapters and concepts to score marks in the highest band.
                                                     
6. Theory. Marks for theory in this specification have been fixed which I believe is around 50. This in my opinion is beneficial as you know exactly how much to need to study and answer. To do well in theory I suggest students to go through them once frequently and understanding them. In this way it will be really easy for you toanswer evaluations. 

7. Find out what works best for you. Make your own patterns, categorize chapters in sections; for example, good - needs practice - need to learn properly - least likely to answer. This will really make things easier and organized for you, instead of looking like a huge syllabus.     

8. Lastly, evaluations. For evaluations you need to have a good idea about relations between transactions and profit/loss and capital and ratios. And it is really easy to do, all you have to do is know what ratio measures what, and whether a transaction is debit or credit. That's it! . This is applicable to every single chapter as evaluation maybe incorporated in any question. 

This is all for now, if anyone has any further questions please comment below. Hope this is going to be helpful 😀😀😁",Anamika Archi,,status,,11/3/2016 8:16,16,5,0,12,3,1,0,0,0,f

I can't imagine how much time, effort and patience you put in to take this group from nothing to where it is now- a model of ""scholastic altruism"" for over 5k students for all over the world. There's no doubt that this brand will reach out to even more when the highly anticipated website goes online (honorable mention: Kawser Nasim). To all the volunteers and fellow members associated with Nerd Community, I'd like to remind you philanthropy and charity should not necessarily be restricted to financial donations. You can still help others just by sharing your knowledge, answering others' questions and fostering curiosity among everyone- and trust me you will not have done any less than those who donate millions of dollars in helping others. Or even better- superheros help people when they are in trouble, YOU can help people when they're in (academics related) trouble- you can be their superhero. So, engage.

*Extra words and phrases #Olevel students should avoid writing in #SectionC*

1) First of all –First is first, thus, you don’t need ""of all"". Ex: First of all, I didn’t tell Morjina your name. Better: First, I didn’t tell Morjina your name.

2) General public – Let’s not use “general public”(seems like army designation) Ex: The portable bathrooms are for the general public. Better: The portable bathrooms are for the public.

3) Future plans – We always plan for future so skip writing “future plans”. Ex: What are your future plans for college? Better: What are your plans for college?

4) Frozen ice – Redundant phrase. You don’t need frozen. Ex: Ben Stokes fell through the frozen ice. Better: Ben Stokes fell through the ice.

5) Final conclusion –Final destination may change even at the last moment but conclusion always comes at last. Ex: He came to a final conclusion that he hated his job. Better: He came to a conclusion that he hated his job. Best: He concluded that he hated his job.

1026292020725036_1261433227210913,"All right!

I am not here to post some motivational stuff about not getting selected in DU or deep quotes about success or stuff. I am here to tell some practical facts that should provide you with at least a little insight about how the real world works in most fields, including academia!

1. Hard work alone is never the key to success. It includes proper strategies, goals and algorithms. Work smart! ভাইয়া, আমার ফ্রেন্ড এত পরে, তাও চান্স পেল না। She didn't follow proper strategies that's all. This is most inherent in coding. You may find the number of digits of an integer by dividing it repeatedly by 10, hard work ain't it? But a smart coder would use an algorithm with less time complexity.  HARD WORK ALONE IS MERELY STUPIDITY.

2. A university alone will never help shape your dreams. It will merely guide you. It's up to you what you do with your life and how you aim for your dreams and use your opportunities. তুমি বুয়েট এ চান্স পাবা অথচ বুয়েটের রিসোর্সেস কে ঠিক ভাবে ব্যবহার করবা না এবং ডিপ্রেসেড থাকবা, বলবা আমার দ্বারা কিছু হবে না, সেটা হবে না। অথচ তোমার ই কোন ফ্রেন্ড হয়ত অন্য কোন ভার্সিটিতে সেইভাবে সুযোগ সুবিধা না পেয়েও কাজ করছে এবং চেষ্টা করছে। There are many people who've simply faded away even though they've received opportunistic events and environment. One of the seniors of our department, Bahauddin Omar bhai, who's now a leading astrophysics and quantum mechanics researcher at the Rice University, USA, once said: ""MAKE THE UNIVERSITY FEEL LUCKY TO BE AROUND YOU, NOT THE OPPOSITE!""

3. Most people will love to see you fail. Yes, this is the harsh truth. You might succeed in countless events, but as soon as you fail, the whole world will turn against you. Best thing is not to care too much about what other people think

4. Work without strings attached. Don't try to fulfill everyone's expectations. They will kill you. Trust me. The fear alone is enough to choke you off a potential success. আমি এক্সাম এ খারাপ করলে বাবা মা কষ্ট পাবে/মার দেবে, these type of thoughts alone are enough to ruin your exams and all.

5. There's no such thing as magic. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg didn't become successful because of some magic. They had opportunities which they used during their childhood and later life. Bill was a student of Lakehead, the school that bought the first computer amongst all schools in the USA back in the 60s/70s. Bill and a few of his friends were quick enough to take up the chance and spend countless hours on programming on the platform. That's one of hundreds of opportunities which helped him to reach where he's today. He used the opportunities he received and see where he's now. Oh and btw, his parents were extremely influential individuals who helped Microsoft secure many deals. :3 

6. Consistency is important. Take too long a break, you lose all your skills. To master any skill, you need 10000 hours of consistent, focused, strategically planned practice.

7. Start early! Don't just dream! Dreaming won't get you anything. Work to make your dreams reality. Discuss ideas about future plans and get working! Young CEOs are a posh nowadays!",Swapnil Saha,,status,,10/25/2016 11:32,194,15,7,147,44,2,1,0,0,m

Please don't write down your answer in bullet points or even numbered points. They expect you to write essay level questions in all 4 units, so the quality of your answer is expected to be quite good. Of course the points matter, yes, but also how you present them. Try reading up news and articles from The Economist, Business Insider, BBC, etc on a daily basis, that helps to improve your writing. But step 1: write in paragraphs, not numbered points.

1026292020725036_1259651910722378,"The Hitchhiker's guide to O'Levels English Language! :D

 After the O'levels results came out this August, many of the future O'level candidates were asking what should they do to obtain an A grade in English. Well I'm not an expert on this, but I can give you some advice which can help you to obtain the best possible marks in each of the three sections depending on your potential.

 Section A consists of 2, sometimes 3, passages followed by some questions regarding those passages. The first thing you should do is to read these passages fully without even looking at the questions. After you're done, read the questions carefully and try to understand what the examiner wants. Then go back to that part of the passage from where you can find your answer and underline it neatly with a pencil. While answering the question, if the question doesn't mention the phrase 'write in your own word,' you should directly copy the answer word by word from the passage. If the question is to be answered in more than one point, look at the mark of that question and answer accordingly. For example, if the question is for 2 marks, your answer must have at least 2 points. If you follow these steps, you can secure good marks provided you can answer without making any grammatical errors. Also, improving your knowledge on vocabulary is important in understanding the nuances of various questions.

 Then comes Section B, Directed Writing. Here they will ask you to write an application or a short extract from a diary or a journal using the facts taken from the given passages in Section A. PLEASE NOTE- DO NOT USE ANY FACT IF THEY ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE PASSAGE. They won’t give credits for such facts even if they are true. You must mention about 22-26 points from the passages to secure the best possible marks.
 There is an easy way, or should I say a 'hack,' to make a good impression about yourself to the examiner in this section. What you have to do is to write down the facts/points required according to the question in the first page of the Section B answer sheet and neatly cross them out with single line over the whole page but make sure they are still readable. I've uploaded a picture, here’s the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8jBQn7LrruzWlJqa0JVNVRmYjg/view?usp=sharing. So, while checking your paper, the examiner will surely notice this page and know how many and which points you've taken from the passages for this section. Thus, it'll be easier for them to check that section and can have a clear idea about your answer. The rest depends on your writing skills.

 Now for the final one, Section C. One thing I must mention about this section is that, the examiner will never expect a 'Shakespeare-styled' writings from you. So try to write your essay in a simple and logical manner. You may think if you use lots of esoteric words, you can impress your examiner. But there is a high chance for a student of this standard to mess up and not using the acceptable synonyms which will result in losing marks. 
 Yes, you can use correct synonyms and write a great essay without losing much marks but you should avoid writing boring lengthy sentences and in the process, commit grammatical errors. Try to make your story interesting using simple languages rather than a complicated one filled up with 'bombastic' vocabularies. Similar guideline is applicable for argumentative writings too.

 On a realistic note, the January candidates still have two months before their exam. Try to practice as many question papers as possible and do get them checked by your teachers. As with everything, Google is your best friend to find sample essays from around the world. 

 Best of luck!

What was #Brexit? Why was it so important? What would its impact be on world economy?

WHAT DID #BREXIT MEAN?
It was a word that had become as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the European Union (EU) – merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit.

WHAT HAPPENED?
A referendum was held on Thursday, 23 June, to decide whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union.

WHAT IS THE EUROPEAN UNION?
The European Union – often known as the EU – is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries. It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other.
It has since grown to become a “single market” allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas – including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.
With GDP of more than $18,000 bn and a population of more than 500 m, it is the biggest economy in the world. Member states remain the most powerful actors within the EU — with Angela Merkel, German chancellor, the bloc’s most powerful leader.

WHAT IS A REFERENDUM?
A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a “Yes” or “No” answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.

WHY DID THE REFERENDUM TAKE PLACE?
Prime Minister David Cameron had promised to hold a referendum if he won the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his own Conservative party MPs and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who argued that Britain had not had a say since 1975, when it voted to stay in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over their daily lives, they argued. Mr Cameron had said: “It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this European question in British politics.”

WHO DID WANT THE UK TO LEAVE THE EU?
The British public was fairly evenly split, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes – 13% of those cast – in May’s general election, campaigns for Britain’s exit from the EU. About half of Conservative MPs, including five cabinet ministers, several Labour MPs and the DUP were also in favour of leaving.

WHY DID THEY WANT THE UK TO LEAVE?
They believed Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.
One of the main principles of EU membership is “free movement”, which means you don’t need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of “ever closer union” and what they see as moves towards the creation of a “United States of Europe”.

WHO WANTED THE UK TO STAY IN THE EU?
Prime Minister David Cameron wanted Britain to stay in the EU. Sixteen members of his cabinet also backed staying in. The Conservative Party had pledged to be neutral in the campaign – but the Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems were all in favour of staying in.
US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany. As mentioned above, according to polls, the British public seemed pretty evenly split on the issue.

WHY DID THEY WANT THE UK TO SAY?
Those who campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU say it got a big boost from membership – it would make selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, could fuel economic growth and help  pay for public services. They also believed Britain’s status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we were more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.

WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THURSDAY’S RESULTS WERE ANNOUNCED?
British voters voted for Leave by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent. As the results were reported on Thursday evening, markets started to panic. The British pound fell from $1.50 earlier in the day to $1.35 in the early hours of Friday morning. That 10 percent drop brought the pound to its lowest value against the dollar since the 1980s.

Initially, David Cameron had vowed to continue in office even if British voters opted to Leave but by Friday morning his position had become politically untenable. He eventually resigned . Boris Johnson, a Conservative former mayor of London and Leave supporter, was considered a leading candidate to replace Cameron. However, it was Theresa Mary May, leader of the Conservative Party, who turned out to become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

So if mu is 4 then mv is -4? So change in momentum is 8?  #physics #kinetictheoryandpressurelaw,Maisa Maliha,,status,,10/23/2016 4:54,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,f

Specialization is better than being a jack of all trades and expert at none. 
But AIS will also make you a jack of all trades as you will be a central part of an organization. And then the added specialization as well. What else do you need? 

Oh and free CIMA classes to make you climb up the ladder in the easiest way possible.

That's it? No. AIS has also been the best fresher team in football, join in to make it the very best in BUP. 

Done? Not yet. With the most qualified and friendlist faculties, learning just got to a whole new level.

I'm not sure how the formula used in the solution was derived. Was it derived using Newton's 3rd law and dividing the tension into components? How is Tsin(theta) balanced in this situation?

Can I solve this using W=Del A x T?
Note: I did try with that and I assumed the area as 4pir^2 instead of the logical 2pir^2(half sphere?) since it's mentioned to be a sphere and my answer came 3 degrees off the given solution(54.something).

""What process can be used to make CH3CH2CH2CH2CHBr into a group of alkenes?""

The question after that said to show the mechanism, and the one after that said to draw the skeletal formulae of the three alkenes formed. 

Can anyone tell me how to solve these? Did they mean that each molecule of the 1-bromo-pentane can be broken into 1 alkene, with 3 variations? If so why say it can be broken into a group of alkenes? It's really eating me up inside that I didn't find such a question in any past paper, or in the book, so I'd appreciate any help.

Among all the FAQ's "" color of the compounds/products/reactants/elements or how can you tell reaction stopped / observation at the end of the reactions "" are most easy ones. You can  gain at least 6/7 marks answering these question just by remembering the Color Chart. 🎨🎨

It's not hard to remember the chart. If you notice carefully you'll see most of them follow a fixed pattern.
For ex : All Group 1 salts are white.
Most of the Copper (II) compounds are Blue.
Most of the Iron (II) compounds are Green.

Find out the rest of the pattern or shortcut method. ✅✅

Hi. So is there anyone here (other than the ones who did transactions with TOEFL) who has faced an issue regarding any of their international transactions using personal credit cards, say for registration process or application Process? Or is t just toefl?
[ long story short, a lot of us sent money for registration or other services to toefl. The bank did send a message to us confirming it but we didn't get any receipt or admission ticket for it]
Even if you have not faced an issue and got through with the process smoothly, please do let me know because I will be sending application fee to UofAlberta tomorrow and I wanted to know if the problem was only occurring for toefl.

 Kangaroos, wallabies, koalas & possums are members of the  mammalian infraclass Marsupialia. Marsupials have the typical characteristics of mammals—e.g., a fur coat. There are, however, striking differences as well as a number anatomical features that separate them from Eutherians .A distinctive characteristic common to these species is that most of the young are carried in a pouch. These animals are endemic to the Australasia and the Americas. The species are believed to have originated in South America and then migrated by land to Australia during the time of the Pangaea. Thus, most of the world's marsupials today are isolated in Australia.",Khadiza Karim Chowdhury Rodella,Photos from Khadiza Karim Chowdhury Rodella's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202054665686416&set=gm.1245262688827967&type=3,10/8/2016 9:29,25,0,0,20,3,2,0,0,0,f

Good Morning Pages 10/03/16
I love Monday mornings. I used to hate them but I have really grown fond of them over the years. I think the biggest reason I didn't like them so much is because I really didn't have a great time in school. I always felt like I could have been creating or doing something else. It would stress me out to be tied to a desk and trying to figure out things I was fairly sure I'd have no use for. I would play hooky and walk into the next town to the comic shop and see what was out. It would inspire me. I guess I just wasn't very inspired in school. I think some of this had to do with knowing very early on in my life that I wanted to be some sort of artist, then, more specifically, a comic artist and writer, a musician. I just knew I wanted to be involved in the arts. So I only acquired skills I thought would help me with that. Looking back, there could have been a few more things I could have used in the math department, though I'm awful at it.
By the time I got to my senior year, I was almost exclusively taking art classes, and in work study. So, I had one ""normal"" class in the morning, whatever that requirement was, then off to art for a solid chunk of the day, then I was allowed to leave school and go to work. I had figured out a way to drop out of gym class, so I didn't need to fill that requirement for the senior year. I could have probably used the exercise but I really couldn't be bothered.
So I entered the workforce early, I was already accepted into SVA by the time half the school year was over, so I was just phoning it in. I had actually entered the workforce earlier than that, at around 15 years old, where I worked for a catholic school uniform store. I handled the stock, and would often swipe patches and I bought myself a cardigan to wear to school. I wore that thing all the time.
College was eye opening. I think the greatest benefit to going was the first year, where the school required you to take every kind of art pretty much, even photography, where I got a D as a grade. I didn't take to the camera well but I took to drawing and abstract painting. I wasn't much good at sculpture either. I remember one of the assignments was that we had to construct a chair as an art piece. My work was so crummy that you couldn't sit in the chair at all, and I chose this horrible floral pattern for the upholstery. It was really a monstrosity. The only thing I created in sculpture class that I ended up liking was part of the assignment involving casting and carving plaster. I decided to make a ""ghost log"". I carved this large chunk of plaster into something that looked like a cartoon log, and then gave it a dark wash and sanded the surfaces to expose the white plaster. I even wrote a song about it.
""Deep in the woods, there was a ghost log..."". And so on.
Today's assignments or possibilities: Umbrella Academy and Doom Patrol. With Umbrella, the 3rd series is worked out so it is only a matter of scripting the scenes and getting it off the Gabriel. With Doom, I need to dive into the next issue, but also plan out where the story is headed for the next year. I have a rough plan of this, as I'm flying a little bit by the seat of my pants, but it's time to bring it in. The core concepts and beats are there, though. The Umbrella Academy characters are old friends I know very well, but some of the Doom characters are new to me, though some of them I had been reading about for years, like Cliff Steele and Larry Trainor, so in a way they are old friends as well. Writing Cliff and Larry is very rewarding.
New York Comicon is this week. I have a pretty light schedule which is good, so I can stay on top of my scripts at night, or during the day when I don't have any obligations to fill. Will really be nice to walk around the city, though, as it has been some time. If I miss anything about New York City, it is the walking. I remember moving to LA and trying to walk places and it was almost impossible, and people look at you like there is something wrong with you for walking. ""Nobody walks in LA"" as the Missing Person song goes. It is really dead on. But NYC has an energy when you're walking around, it gives back to you. Now that Doom Patrol is out, I am excited to meet people to see what they think of it, see if they have latched on to any characters this early, or where they think it is headed. It has been nice keeping my head down and just working through things, though it is pretty solitary.
Alright, I'm off to work. Lots of stories and beats and characters to figure out.
Hope you have a great day, stay in school.

I find this book extremely useful for enriching your vocabulary, not just for standardized tests, but for overall purposes in reading, writing and of course, communicating verbally in an intelligent and effective manner.

The New SAT requires mastery of college level words, no matter what people may tell you. They disguise these words within passages, thus making it essential that you have a  rich vocabulary for good comprehension of the passages.

The best thing about this book is — it takes an etymological approach to teaching words. You will learn the roots of the words you will be learning, alongside learning what they mean. As a result, you will be able to assume, with moderate accuracy, the meaning of many different unfamiliar words related to the same word root. You will also learn about constructing new meaningful words by properly using prefixes and suffixes to these word roots. I suggest anyone serious about enriching their vocabulary, no matter what their reasons behind it may be, to read and study this book. It's also available in hard copy at many places including Rajlokkhi, and ofcourse Nilkhet.

1026292020725036_1242840942403475,"Last time, there a hot debate in the group about which language a beginner programmer should pursue and why should someone ever learn programming.

Computer programming is something that teaches you how to think. Programming a computer is virtually equivalent to programming an artificial brain; you are teaching someone how to think based on how you think.

There's no doubt that everyone should learn programming. I shall still stand firm on my ground that if you really want to learn how to think, DON'T TAKE THE EASY WAY in programming. Don't, for God's sake, start with a language (Python for example) that does most of the thinking for you and leaves you with nothing to think about. And, don't do haphazardly for the sake of doing it and adding it your CV.",Swapnil Saha,Code.org,video,https://www.facebook.com/Code.org/videos/1102769229819379/,10/5/2016 11:12,16,4,1,15,1,0,0,0,0,m

1026292020725036_1237221842965385,"#How_to_get_the_CommonApp_Fee_Waiver
One of the ways you can greatly reduce the cost of university applications is through the CommonApp fee waiver. While there are many categories that can get you the discount, we as international students often fall in one category: Approval from our Guidance Counselor that we NEED the fee waiver. 
Often times applicants wonder how to get the elusive Fee Waiver that could save you THOUSANDS of taka. Hell, I applied to 15 universities without spending a dime. Truth be told, the Commonapp fee waiver isn't as elusive as we think it is. All you have to do is convince your G.C. that you need the waiver and he approves it. And once he/she does, it's pretty simple.
So, I created a DUMMY ACCOUNT of a Guidance Counselor and an applicant, sent a request to the Counselor for the fee waiver and this is how he approves: by selecting the right option and typing his/her name as a signature. 
So, if you're using commonapp, find a nice GC and convince them to do this and help you save $30-60 for every college you apply to.

These tips could be helpful for prospective students, and probably can be extended to admission to most Universities in the US.

""How Can You Best Prepare for Harvard?

We hope you will read our thoughts about choosing high school courses that will provide a strong base for a liberal arts education. But in summary, we recommend:

The study of English for four years: close and extensive reading of the classics of the world’s literature
Four years of a single foreign language
The study of history for at least two, and preferably three years: American history, European history, and one additional advanced history course
The study of mathematics for four years, including the particular topics described
The study of science for four years: physics, chemistry, and biology, and preferably one of these at an advanced level
Frequent practice in the writing of expository prose
Various important secondary school subjects, such as art and music, are not specifically mentioned in our recommendations. The omission of these subjects should not be interpreted as a value judgment. We are concerned only with secondary school subjects for which we have data that suggest they are specific prerequisites for college work.

Academic preparation and admission

While we believe that the conclusions summarized on this page will meet the expectations of many other selective colleges, let us say a word about Harvard, since it was here that the data underlying our conclusions were gathered.

This overview is not intended to provide a formula that will ensure admission to Harvard. Our admissions policies are based on many criteria. Some are academic; others are not.

Our Admissions Office chooses carefully from a broad range of applicants who seem to us to offer the most promise for future contributions to society. Not all of the students who are best prepared for college will be among those with the most future promise, nor are all of the most promising well prepared academically.

While the heart of the matter will always lie in academic promise, we prize candidates with special talents and with outstanding personal qualities; we are interested in students who excel in one or more extracurricular activities; and we seek a distinctive and diverse national and international student body.

Most of all we look for students who make the most of their opportunities and the resources available to them, and who are likely to continue to do so throughout their lives.

We believe that you should prepare for college by mastering certain subjects and skills. You should demonstrate your proficiency in the areas described below by taking SAT II Subject Tests, Advanced Placement tests, and International Baccalaureate tests.""",Ragib Shahriar,,status,,10/2/2016 5:25,15,10,1,15,0,0,0,0,0,m

1026292020725036_1238346136186289,"Guys, I sat for my SAT I exam last year and I have some general advice for everyone from what I observed last time.
1) Bring your passport. You will not be allowed to sit for the exam under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES without the passport.
2) Carry at least 2 HB pencils with you. Try your best to keep the Answer Booklet as CLEAN as possible (very important). The machine which checks the scripts is extremely sensitive. That's why you should avoid using a 2B pencil.
3) Bring water and food. You'll get breaks after every 2 sections. Since the exam is very lengthy you don't want to get tired by the end of the exam (especially if you take the essay).
4) Wear warm clothing. At least make sure that you cover your feet. The exam halls can get really chilly and you don't want brain freeze in the middle of a CR section.
5) Bring your own watch if you can. Obvious reasons. Time slips away REALLY QUICKLY when the questions are hard.
6) If you have 5 mins left and see that you still have ~8 questions left to answer, first bubble in all your completed answers on the answer booklet and then try to answer the incomplete ones. Better to get 500 than 0.
7) For maths, if you don't get the question go Plug-and-play.
8) For reading, read the questions before the answers. They provide you with context and prepare yourself subconsciously so you can easily spot what you need to find.
Best of luck. Hope everyone aces it #SAT #LastMinAdvice",Abrar Rahman,,status,,9/30/2016 9:46,68,16,0,52,16,0,0,0,0,m

Like, I really love the subject and had it for my O levels. Here's how things stand: 
I have AS in Jan for 4 subjects and am sitting for Further Maths units in May. So that makes it 5. 
Then I'd have SATs coming up along with the admission season midway through the year. 

While I can handle pressure, I'm a lazy slacker. So, I'm kinda confused about how to go about it.

A few free advises to all of the candidates,
1. Be on time. At least half an hour before the scheduled exam time. Going 1 hour before would be the best, I suppose.

2. Be careful while answering as there is negative marking. Think before you choose the option so that you don't have to change your answer later.

3. Time management is very essential. If you are not sure about an answer don't waste your time on it, go to the next question. If you have extra time after finishing all the answers then come back to the unanswered questions.

4. Take Pens, Pencils, Passport, Admit Card and all the other required stationery items.

5. Write everything very clearly and legibly, such as your exam roll.

6. AND Do NOT panic under any circumstances. Stay calm and give the exam!

Hope you all do well.

A rope rests on two platforms which are both inclined at an angle θ (which you are free to pick), as shown. The rope has uniform mass density, and its coefficient of friction with the platforms is 1. The system has left-right symmetry. What is the largest possible fraction of the rope that does not touch the platforms? What angle θ allows this maximum value?",Ragib Shahriar,,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1210891172282482&set=gm.1234993296521573&type=3,9/26/2016 10:18,6,10,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,m

This short video will hopefully provide you with a brief summary of PCR and make it easier to remember the key concepts (and also show you how there needs to be a Disney Musical featuring biologists). Do sing along:

'There was a time when to amplify DNA,
You had to grow tons and tons of tiny cells.
Then along came a guy named Dr. Kary Mullis,
Said you can amplify in vitro just as well.

Just mix your template with a buffer and some primers,
Nucleotides and polymerases too.
Denaturing, annealing, and extending,
Well it’s amazing what heating and cooling and heating will do.

[Chorus]
PCR when you need to detect mutation (detect mutation)
PCR when you need to recombine (recombine)
PCR when you need to find out who the daddy is (who’s your daddy?)
PCR when you need to solve a crime (solve a crime)'",Nazifa Tabassum,The PCR Song,video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5yPkxCLads,9/27/2016 6:46,3,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,f

Common errors to avoid in Physics: Post #1

We've all come across questions like ""State why the waves are emitted as pulses instead of a continuous wave"" when answering questions about echo location. I remember the answers in some of the very old mark schemes accepted answers such as ""continuous waves create standing/stationary waves"". However, be warned, the newer mark schemes strictly REJECT this answer. I still find many students writing this down blindly when it comes to answering these questions. This is incorrect.

The correct answer for this question is ""so that the time taken for one pulse to return is measured before the next pulse is emitted"". 

Also, other common mistakes I still find students making is that they forget to multiply the distance by 2 when they try to find the speed of the pulse. Since the time taken is the total time taken by the pulse to go and return, the distance traveled is also twice the distance, i.e. v=2d/t.",Rifayat Raisa,,status,,9/17/2016 1:41,24,1,1,19,5,0,0,0,0,f

This is from practice test 1: 

https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/sat-practice-test-1-essay.pdf

UPDATE: My interpretation:
The three noticeable aspects I could find was the use of appeal to emotions, imagery and anecdotes and reasoning. 
Carter starts with imagery, describing the area in concise details. This helps paint an image of the serene place in the mind of the readers/listeners.  This, with the imagery used in anecdote in the next para, acts as a base for him to persuade the audience that the wilderness should not be “consumed by a web..”, which might “disturb countless numbers of animals…” The audience will start empathizing with Carter as they start to imagine the horror of it all. 
The anecdote also serves to prove Carter’s credibility. The audience will then feel like he knows what he is talking about as he had first-hand experience with the place, and so cares about it. 
In many other places, the passage appeals to emotions of the reader. Carter evokes a sense of patriotism when he says ""it is a symbol.."" in para 8. This helps his cause by provoking American people to leave the area unscathed for the sake of the country. It also draws out sentiments. People will be more inclined to preserve what is left of the “remnant of frontier America”. The ending of para 7, where establishing oil drills is compared to “tearing open the heart” evokes sadness and horror in reader’s mind. Again the idea of taking away something that means a lot to the indigenous people (in para 6) makes the audience feel like they’re being selfish.
The third device he uses is reasoning or logos. This is most noticeable when he says that th Arctic Refuge might only provide 1-2% of the oil consumed by the country and that the American people can “conserve more than that amount by driving more fuel-efficient vehicles. This shows that there is a better alternative to the action, which will benefit not only few but many. The last line also serves as both an appeal to logic and also to emotions.

THIS IS IN NO WAY A COMPLETE ESSAY. I just wrote the things that came into my mind.

Do not hesitate; write whatever it is that comes to mind. Criticism is welcomed.

SAT takers (esp those who had said ""yes"" to the poll) please participate.

SICK - It is the less formal of the two words. It usually describes short-term diseases or ailments, like flu, and is commonly used to refer to a feeling of nausea. Think of a sick child who stays home instead of going to school or a person who feels sick to their stomach after a roller coaster ride.

Examples: 
Mosharraf Karim felt sick during the shooting of a tele-film and had to go home immediately.
After the roller coaster ride, Babu bhai felt ill.

ILL – It is more formal and is used to describe long- and short-term diseases or ailments. A person who is not in good health because of something serious like cancer or pneumonia might be said to be ill. On the contrary a person who is affected with a minor fever or cold can also be called ill. Like sick, ill also refers to a feeling of nausea.

Examples:
I was ill for a time few weeks ago, but I am fine now.
Momtaj looks ill. Farhan wonders what’s wrong with her.

This years theme : ""Climbing Mount Improbable""

There are more ways to be discouraged than inspired in this world.

Rules, traditions, expectations, obligations weigh us down until life becomes something to survive than to live. Yes, innovation and leadership is an adventure. The leader, the entrepreneur, the adventurer – all are manifestations of the ever-hungry soul yearning for the unknown and the uncharted. In their ventures, they sometimes strike gold and are immortalized in the annals of posterity.

However, more often than not, they fail miserably and beyond the point of no-return. Those who succeed live to tell their tale, while the less fortunate are lost to oblivion.

But it is human nature to take the path not taken, to look precarity in the eye. What is leadership and innovation if not the willingness to risk it all for the biggest idea of your life?

TEDxBUET chronicles the tales of those who made the impossible possible, those who turned the unthinkable into the quotidian.

It is the story of climbing Mt. Improbable.

1026292020725036_1075615702459334,"CODING FOR ALL: THE HOWS AND THE WHAT'S:
So, you people are all passionate about computer programming and application development these days. Cool! Hats off! You guys are passionate about two topics which I used to fear at your age due to the inbuilt horror attached to the term ""programming""! However, times have changed. Coding is now not just a skill that would glorify your curriculum vitae, it's a MUST! Personally, I would be surprised if the individual sitting next to me of my generation did not know how to code, regardless of his/her majors or interests.

As generations progress, each generation becomes subsequently advanced in technical fields than the previous generation. For example: I started making robots and embedded systems when I was in my Freshman Year at university; you guys are already doing that. Hats off again! :) 

One of the most common questions that starting coders ask: Where should I start? Well, there are countless possible paths. I would personally ask you to first get to know some computer fundamentals such as number systems, number arithmetic and basic structure of a computer. These would help you a lot when you start to code for real. Next, choose a programming language that you would use as the key to enter the world of programming. There are hundreds of computer languages out there, but I would strongly recommend that you start with C. C is kinda like a hub from which all other programming languages are accessible, although the reverse is not true. Once you learn C, you will easily get to learn other advanced programming languages; after all, the syntax of all programming languages are similar in one way or the other. 

I would recommend that you start with this course: https://alison.com/courses/Diploma-in-Programming-in-C
I had personally completed this course to supplement my basics in C programming during my Y-1 S-1 ""Computer Programming"" course. This course is free, easy to understand, self-paced and starts with the very basics, including the computer fundamentals required for programming as I had stated in the last paragraph. It requires no previous programming experience. You don't need to install any extra Integrated Development Environments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) on your computer as the course features a web-based IDE where you can practice coding. It even features small tests that are marked automatically so that you can get to know how much you've learned. After completing this course, you will have a solid base in C programming, although you will not fully learn the different facets of C. Besides, if you are comfortable with books and want to learn all facets of C programming, go for Teach Yourself C by Herbert Schildt. If you want to learn programming in Bengali, go for Tamim Shahriar Subin's ""Computer programming"" (Link: http://cpbook.subeen.com/). If you want to learn programming in a childish but logical manner, here's a solution: https://hourofcode.com

If you are badass, you can create wonderful GUI (www.linfo.org/gui.html) games just by using C. However, using C for creating commercial applications and interactive programs would be a bad idea. Knowing C doesn't make you ""productive"" in the market. Furthermore, C doesn't encompass Object Oriented Programming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), which is now fundamental to programming. So, what's the solution? Well, learn a new language! Now, since you are already an accomplished coder, you can choose which language you wanna learn, depending on your tastes and needs. For example, during my robotics and embedded systems project development, I found out the need for new applications that could interact with my projects. Thus, I started learning XML and Java, which seemingly are the languages used for android application development.
1. Interested in general software development? Aim for Python, C++ and Java.
2. Want to develop cool applications or softwares for Windows? C# and C++ will help you do it.
3. Want to develop android applications and games? Java & XML are the bosses.
4. An IOS freak eh? Swift is cool!
5. Nowadays, a lot of people are moving to web development. HTML, Javascript, PHP, CSS and Java are some of the languages you need to know.
6. Want to code robots and projects? Learn the Arduino, Processing, VHDL and MikroC.

Udacity hosts free tutorials and courses on all of the above mentioned programming languages. Since android programming is the new posh, here's a link to a really good course for beginner android developers: https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837
You do need some other tools like the JDK and Android Studio to start making android programs, all explained in the tutorial. If you want to make apps without coding, use the MIT App Inventor (appinventor.mit.edu). Although your applications won't be that cool, it's a good starting point.

Many of you want to make cool games. Game development is a challenge for beginner coders; since gaming involves a lot other than just programming, game developers usually work in groups consisting of designers, programmers, audio engineers, video editors, directors, producers and artists. However, making mini games with all those graphics and all is not impossible. Make sure you learn computer aided drawing using Adobe Illustrator, AutoCAD and Maya. Choose your platform and programming language and you are good to go.

There's no doubt that there's a great demand out there for mouse potatoes! Coding will open new realms in what you can do, limited only by your imagination. Programming just doesn't narrow you down to personal computers, you can even program hardware, embedded systems and robots! You can even create your own startup just by using coding skills. 

Failures come for free with coding. Even expert programmers rarely write bug-free codes when they develop applications. Hence, it's important not to give up and pull out your hair when you encounter errors in programming. Simply google up your problem; even Google ""googles"" when they get stuck! Programming requires dedication and patience, it's something you will never get to learn properly in your life. A degree in CSE will not necessarily land you in Google, while someone studying Mathematics may ace with her dedication, passion and coding skills. 

All right, so I think I've covered all the points except outsourcing, which I'll cover some day. Till then, good luck, and lets end this discussion in different ""languages""! Observe how similar they are to each other.

1. Happy coding! (English)
2. printf(""Happy coding!""); //C
3. System.out.println(""Happy coding""); //Java
4. android:text=""Happy coding"" //XML
5. cout << ""Happy coding!"" //C++
6. Serial.println(""Happy coding!""); //Arduino
7. print ""Happy coding!"" //python",Swapnil Saha,Online C Programming Course – C Programming | ALISON,link,https://alison.com/courses/Diploma-in-Programming-in-C,2/7/2016 6:53,36,4,1,36,0,0,0,0,0,m

I have AS exams in Jan. It's not like I'm asking for study tips. I'm usually a good student [ O levels result: 10A*s, 1 A, Jan 2016].
 I just want to know how different people motivate themselves and perhaps overcome chronic procrastination.  
Also, I'm sick of people telling me how certain teachers are great. It's like I understand and mean no offense to them. But my parents absolutely won't let me attend their coaching classes, so someone telling me that they smashed it without going to the mainstream popular teachers (you know who) would be some sort of motivation too, I guess. :3",Md Saquib Shahzad,,status,,8/26/2016 23:34,66,24,0,61,3,0,0,2,0,m
